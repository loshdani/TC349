#Heroku.com Critique

Heroku is a company that provides a cloud applicaton platform for web developers to deploy and scale  
their applications. Heroku supports Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Java, Python, and Scala; it also interfaces  
with git to deploy instantly. The main page is broken down into four categories: Forget Servers, Run  
Anything, See Everything, and Trust & Manage. Within each of these tabs there is a brief explanation  
and a link to a more in depth discussion of each topic. Below this there is a button to click and see  
how their product works as well as a button to sign up for their service. In the footer there are  
several links that are divided into categories for quick navigation from any place on the website.

On the top navigation there are several items that are left justified including: How it Works, Pricing,  
Add-ons, Dev Center, Help, Contact, and Login. The "How it Works" section really does a fantastic job of  
accurately explaining how heroku manages applications that are built on top of their platform. The pages  
that explain use a two column design with information on the left and a picture that helps explain  
things on the right. This set up is a very effective means to convey their process.

The Pricing page is also very intuitive and lets users build their platform based on the number of  
"dynos" working on their website. If the website gets increased traffic just simply add more Worker  
Dynos to process the increased traffic, and so on. It is a highly customizable system with a very  
intuitive interface to tweak the website just as the owner sees fit.

Overall the website has a very nice look to it with simple, but well organized pages. Many of the pages  
are laid out with intuitive tools to help understand exactly where your money is going and how it will  
affect your website as a whole. Heroku is an amazing looking website that I have very few complaints  
about.
