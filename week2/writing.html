    <h2>> Bio Page</h2>
    <Assignments>
		<p>I'm a Senior at MSU currently studying Media and Information Technology. I'm currently interested in 	digitial design including web design, flash animation, and database administration. I was drawn to the digital design industry through the beauty of digital games and the unique style of Japanese animation. I was an intern at Valassis in Graphic Services as well as Mission Critical Computing as a Database Administrator. </p>
        <p>My skillset is both technical and creative with experience in Adobe Creative Suite as well as several programming languages such as: SQL, HTML, CSS3, Javascript, C++, C#, and Python. While working at Valassis I was one of three awards given to a group of twenty interns titled the Risk Taker Award. In addition I am an active member of the MSU Anime Club as well as an officer for Lansing's first annual anime convention: Shutocon.</p>

   	<h2>> Critique of Panic.com</h2>
        <Assignments>
        	<p>Panic.com is your simple website out there for an up and coming app development company. Like many websites now adays the website is very minimalist. The homepage is simply a portal to learn about the different apps that the company produces. They also have quick method to request help with specific programs or just ask them a quick question on Twitter. It's a very accesable website and gets users where they want to go quickly. It should also be noted that Panic has a blog linked to their homepage as well. Again, the design here is simple and gives a feeling reminiscent of looking at paper pinned to a noteboard. Overall the website is very well put together; its simple, but informative. </p>
