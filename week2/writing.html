    <Assignments>
		<p>I'm a Senior at MSU currently studying Media and Information Technology. I'm currently interested in 	digitial design including web design, flash animation, and database administration. I was drawn to the digital design industry through the beauty of digital games and the unique style of Japanese animation. I was an intern at Valassis in Graphic Services as well as Mission Critical Computing as a Database Administrator. </p>
        <p>My skillset is both technical and creative with experience in Adobe Creative Suite as well as several programming languages such as: SQL, HTML, CSS3, Javascript, C++, C#, and Python. While working at Valassis I was one of three awards given to a group of twenty interns titled the Risk Taker Award. In addition I am an active member of the MSU Anime Club as well as an officer for Lansing's first annual anime convention: Shutocon.</p>
