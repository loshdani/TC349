In previous courses I have had a very limited knowledge of text editors out there in the wild and have since then started to parse through the options available. I've looked into Notepad++ which works fairly well and appears as if it is updated regularly. For a student like myself, the single best part about Notepad++ is the fact that it's open source. It also supports a multitude of different text-based languages. Although it is versatile and has some nice features it seemed to be lacking auto-completion which was a problem for me. 

The text editing application I eventually settled on was Dreamweaver. Although the application takes up quite a bit of memory and there's a ton of features that I will likely never use, it still has very nice auto-completion for all of the HTML and CSS coding. There is the downside that it is not open source, but it really is a great program, if just a little bulky.
