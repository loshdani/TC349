Critique for the website www.jasonsantamaria.com

The design is simple and easy to follow with the main menu allowing for navigation at the top of the page. The designer as adopted a minimalist design to his website with a chronological flow to his home page making highlighted articles easy to find. Articles are also sorted by category for easy tagging and locating. 

The short descriptions located on the homepage are often cut too short to pique interest in the article, however, the articles with a picture preview draw attention to them quite nicely. It's a shame that the author of the website doesn't add articles more frequently. The website would look much more credible if it had articles posted say, at least once a week. The website seems to be a mashup between a personal portfolio work in progress, articles written by the designer, and books that the designer endorses. It leaves me feeling like the webpage is reaching in multiple directions, but exceling in none of them. 

To summarize, the navigation, minimalist design, and articles are great aspects of the website, however, the developer seems to be half commited to the website with sparse article updates and by simply trying to strech the website into too many directions at once.
