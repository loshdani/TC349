#Vimeo.com Review

The online video sharing website, Vimeo has a very bold and straight to the point header slapped right on the front of their website: "Your videos belong here". With a statement so direct and certain that their video hosting service will service your uploading and viewing needs how could you not be interested? 

The website style shares the boldness of the header by placing short statements in large text centered in the screen. As you scroll down you see a short statement in very large font and then something to interact with such as signing up, watching a video the staff picked, features of the website, and how it is different from its competitors. 

The homepage is simple enough and it just so happens that browsing videos on the website happens to be a breeze as well. When exploring the videos on the website you can divide the available videos into easy to approach groups such as Comedy, Art, Music, etc. These options are laid out in a nice grid like fashion with images representing each category. Within these categories you can start viewing videos by the time uploaded, go into further sub-categories, or simply search for the video you want. 

All in all, there is quite a bit to do on Vimeo and a user can spend hours watching the thousands of videos in each category. It doesn't quite have the same depth as competetor site Youtube, but in some ways that's a good thing as the overall quality of the videos usually seems to be higher.
