Etsy Review

As soon as you open the etsy.com homepage you can tell the webpage is simply trying to do too much at once. The homepage just seems to be a unorganized mixture of different items for sale. Essentially, the website is a medium for smaller designers to sell their products to anyone willing to purchase them. These products are organized into a few different categories on the left navigation bar of the website as well as displayed down the page in what seems to be random.

Once inside one of these categories the page becomes much more comprehensible for the end user. Sub-categories are laid out in a stylish fashion that manages to keep the page feeling fresh and clutter free. From there, users can browse the sub-category and search for items within it. The website also has a few nice features like shopping for items based on gift ideas, colors, or categories. It should also be noted the website has a blog page, community pages, and the ability to register with the website for weddings and other events. 

Overall, the website has plenty of great things to offer and are easy to browse once in the correct sub-category. However, the main page can be disorienting for the standard user with seemingly random items displayed for sale.
