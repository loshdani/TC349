#Happy Cog Review

The website Happy Cog is a website that is very easy on the eyes with it's simplistic, and straight forward design. The website has a clean header and horizontal navigation at the top of the page that support simplistic yet appealing body. The website begins by supporting itself with the several satisfied clients they've had in the past such as MTV: O Music Awards, Zappos.com, and Fonts.com. Not only does it state the satisfaction of these clients, but HappyCog also goes a step further by allowing visitors to click on a "Prove It" button for each of these clients. There they list any awards, quotes from employees at the company and specifics on how they designed each of these websites. 

The website makes a very powerful argument that they are a great design company and then backs it up with their own case studies on the website. All in all, it is a simple enough website with elements people have come to expect from a top tier web design company.
